# Archive Directory for Plots

This directory contains archived visualization files that are no longer actively used in the project but are kept for reference.

## Contents

- `feature_correlation.png` - Feature correlation plot from earlier model versions
- `prediction_matrix.png` - Prediction matrix visualization
- `svm_roc_curve.png` - ROC curve for SVM model
- `svm_decision_boundary.png` - Decision boundary visualization for SVM
- `svm_feature_importance.png` - Feature importance plot for SVM model
- `svm_learning_curve.png` - Learning curve for SVM model

## Usage

If you need to reference these visualization files, they can be viewed directly from this directory. The current active visualizations are maintained in the parent directory (`src/plots/`).
